# Malagasy Rules

_ Piero and I are building this as a knowledge base for our attempt at learning Malagasy, and maybe you'll get some feeling for the language as well :) _

## Vowels:

- A => short, German A, like in **a**mbulance
- E => short, German E, like in **e**scape
- I => German I, like in **e**valuate
- O => German U, like in **u**ltra
- Y => English E, like in k**e**y

## Word Pronunciation

- Emphasize the first vowel
- Shallow middle vowels
- Omit final vowel
- Pronounce 2 or 3 characters at a time
- Z => s
- tr => tsch
- dr => dsch
- Both depend on the region you're in, the previous pronunciation is the official one

## Sentence Structure

1. Negation comes first (Tsy)
2. Verb
3. Object
4. Adjective
5. Subject

## Verbs

- Most verbs start with **m**
- Past tense: exchange **m** with **n**
- Future: exchange **m** with **h** (This is like the best thing ever)

## Personal Pronouns

|     | Singular   | Plural                                |
| --- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st | aho, izaho | isika (inclusive), izahay (exclusive) |
| 2nd | ianao      | ianareo                               |
| 3rd | izy        | izy ireo                              |

## Special Rules

- Pronounce final vowel if the word ends with:

```
  - ka
  - tra/tro
```

- Object + Possession

```
  - rano => water
  - rano*ko* => my water
  - rano*nao* => your water
  - rano*ny* => his/her water
  - ranon*tsika* => our water
  - rano*nay* => your water
  - rano*n'isy reo* => their water
```
