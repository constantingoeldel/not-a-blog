# Malagasy Rules

## Vowels:

- A => short, German A, like in **a**mbulance
- E => short, German E, like in **e**scape
- I => German I, like in **e**valuate
- O => German U, like in **u**ltra
- Y => English E, like in k**e**y

## Word Pronunciation

- Emphasize the first vowel
- Shallow middle vowels
- Omit final vowel
- Pronounce 2 or 3 characters at a time
- tr => tsch
